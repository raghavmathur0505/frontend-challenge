# Griffin Group Global Front End Development Challenge

Hi! Thank you for your interest in [Griffin Group Global][g3website]. Our evaluation processes begins with an open-ended coding challenge that we will discuss during your interview. There is not one correct way to approach this challenge. Rather, we would like to see your approach and your creativity in solving the problem.

We appreciate that any coding challenge represents an investment of your time. We hope you see the value in having a code sample that is relatable to both of us for the interview. Should you be unsuccessful, you should feel free to use the code you developed for this challenge in any way that you would like.

If you are successful, then we will set up an in-person interview and use this code as the starting point in our conversation.

# The Challenge
Griffin Group Global creates REST based microservices that are presented in a variety of ways. We use iOS native swift, Android based Java and JS based frameworks such as React for creating responsive web based presentations.

The challenge is to create a front end presentation for the [Star Wars API][swapi]. The idea is for you to have fun and be creative with your presentations. The star wars API has a standard restful interface for much of the star wars universe. These include:
- [Planets](https://swapi.co/api/planets/)
- [Spaceships](https://swapi.co/api/starships/)
- [Vehicles](https://swapi.co/api/vehicles/)
- [People](https://swapi.co/api/people/)
- [Films](https://swapi.co/api/films/)
- [Species](https://swapi.co/api/species/)

## Minimum Challenge Requirements
We would like a minimum capability. These are:
- Provide a presentation that provides a list of the star wars people
- In this list, when the specific person is clicked, the persons name and gender are displayed.
- Either a mobile application or a browser based presentation shall be created. If choosing a browser based presentation, it should render in Chrome, Safari and Firefox. IE and Edge support at your discretion.

## Where to concentrate your effort
In a UX/UI presentation, there are many areas that could be addressed. While implementing the minimum requirements, please feel to implement one or more items in these areas. Please do not feel limited to these areas if you would like to add your take on frontend development.

- Providing more information about the star wars universe by following some of the extra links in the JSON data model
- Error handling
- Debug statements
- [TDD]
- Encrypted communications
- Caching
- UX, reducing the amount of input from the user
- Responsive presentation, determining the screen size and autoscaling the display

# Prerequisites
- A basic understanding of source code control, [git][git-scm] is required.
- You must make your code available via a [GitHub][github] account.
- All JavaScript shall be written using [ES6][ES6] standards.

# Getting Started
1. Fork this [repository][repository].
1. Clone the fork to your personal machine.
1. Start coding.
1. Commit changes to your fork as you see fit.

# Submission

When you are comfortable with your results, please email your fork to
[g3-dev@griffingroupglobal.com](mailto:g3-dev@griffingroupglobal.com). Please keep your emails short and to the point.

Any specific notes or further information you would like to add about your submittal, should be included in the GitHub project, as additional [Common Mark][commonmark] notes.

Do not feel as though you must create a public fork of this repository. You are free to create a throwaway GitHub account or private fork. In those cases, please let us know so that we may send you the GitHub IDs to add to the repository.

# Evaluations

We realize there are many items to look at when creating a user interface. Please do not feel like like you have to do everything. Please feel free to use any frontend language you wish. Use your strengths to your advantage. If you gravitate more towards design, provider a more visually appealing interface. If you gravitate more towards data consumption, provide more capability by using the API routes. Give us a heads up by documenting your code to let us know where and why you concentrated on certain
items.

As you develop your solution, you may have ideas on other avenues to pursue. Please feel free to include them inline as documented source or as additional [Common Mark][commonmark] compliant notes in your fork.

We look for creativity, originality, and a good user experience in your application if that's an area you focused on.

We look for readability, good architectural decisions, modularity, and a solid approach to testing in your code.
